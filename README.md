# redditWebApp
Reddit Web App Client using Reddit's JSON API - ongoing project but currently includes search query tool, subreddit search and top level comment modal display. 
<h3>Searching through reddit is a breeze</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enter your search and quickly access what you've been looking</li>
<li>Narrow your search down by relevance or top posts as well as when the post was posted (hour, week, all time)</li>
<li>Access your recent searches on the left bar and come back to them whenever you need to.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Minimal Design&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Top navigation includes search bar and filter selections. Simple as that.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Have a lot of recent searches? No worries, the left bar is scrollable to avoid page scroll.</li>
<li>Top level comments are quickly accessible through a pop-up modal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>Reddit Mini is as simple and easy to use as it gets, but there are always things to improve on. Here are some of the things that I am currently working on:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Recently searched items&nbsp;will open up that search query for quicker access to what you were looking for</li>
<li>Extend the amount of comments accessible through the modal</li>
<li>Mobile friendly design&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
